            <h2>History and Notes on Chickadilla Soup</h2>
            <div class="historyContent">
                <p>Chickadilla soup is also known as Tortilla Soup and has roots in <b>Spain</b> and Mexico 
                    from the 16th century. Indigenous people in Mexico would consume corn tortillas,
                    tomatoes, and chillies as a main part of their diet. The Spanish then introduced 
                    Chicken and Cheese which was brought to the US in the <i>16th</i> century. The Aztecs 
                    also had a similar soup that had chicken broth, roasted tomatoes, onions, garlic,
                    and chilies. The name doesn't have historical roots and is likely from a more 
                    modern-American combination of Chicken Tortilla and Chicken enchilada soup. </p>

                <p>Chickadilla soup is a recipe my family has been cooking for a very long time,
                    and I remember having it when I was younger. It's a very fufilling meal on it's own 
                    but can also be served with tortilla chips, avocado, or oyster crackers.  This soup
                    is really good for freezing, even for several months, and eating later in the year. My family usually
                    eats it around the start of the fall season.
